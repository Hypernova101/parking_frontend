  <h1>Introduction to Functions</h1>

  <p>In programming, a <strong>function</strong> is like a little machine that does a specific job whenever you ask it to.</p>

  <h2>What is a Function?</h2>
  <p>Think of a function as a recipe in a cookbook. Just like a recipe tells you how to make a cake step-by-step, a function tells the computer how to do a task step-by-step.</p>

  <p>When you want to use the recipe, you "call" it. The function then follows the instructions inside and gives you the result.</p>

  <h2>Why Use Functions?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Save Time:</strong> Instead of writing the same code over and over, you write a function once and reuse it.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep Things Organized:</strong> Functions help break a big problem into smaller parts.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Code Easier to Understand:</strong> Functions have names that describe what they do.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Example of a Function</h2>
  <p>Here is a simple example in JavaScript:</p>

  <p>If you call <code>greet("Alice")</code>, it will give back <em>"Hello, Alice!"</em>.</p>

  <h2>Try It Yourself!</h2>
  <p>Imagine you want to add two numbers. You could write a function like this:</p>

  <p>Calling <code>addNumbers(3, 5)</code> will give you <em>8</em>.</p>
