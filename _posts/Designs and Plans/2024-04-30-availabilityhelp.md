*SmartParkSD – Parking Made Predictable*

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Enter Your Destination  
Start by typing in an address or location into the **search bar** at the top.  
You can also tap **“Use My Location”** to let the page auto-detect where you are.

> 🧭 Tip: Use landmarks or street names for quicker results!

---

## 🗺️ Step 2: View the Prediction Map  
You’ll see a **waypoint marker** showing nearby parking spots:

Click any marker to get detailed predictions for that meter.

- Location
- Meter Name
- Availability Prection

---

## 📊 Step 3: Read Prediction Details  
When you click a location, a **popup** shows:

- Confidence score (e.g., 80% chance it’s free)  
- Cost (if any)  
- Meter ID and street  
- Historical usage trends

> 🧠 This builds trust in what the model is telling you.

## ✍️ Step 4: Give Feedback  
Help improve predictions! After parking, tell us if it was accurate:

👍 Yes – it matched reality  
👎 No – it was wrong  
📩 Optional comment to explain
