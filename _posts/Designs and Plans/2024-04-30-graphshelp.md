# 📈 How to Use the Parking History & Insights Tool  
*SmartParkSD – Make Smarter Decisions with Data*

---

## 📊 Step 1: View Historical Occupancy Graphs  
Once selected, you'll see **graphs showing past availability patterns**:

- Hour-by-hour parking trends  
- Weekday vs. weekend differences  
- Occupancy rates over time  

> ⏳ Use the time range selector to zoom in or view long-term trends.

---

## 📅 Step 2: Compare by Day and Time  
Use filters to compare data:

- Specific days of the week  
- Peak vs. off-peak hours  
- Event days (if available)

> 🔍 This helps identify when spots are usually free or full.

---

## 🧠 Step 3: Use Insights for Planning  
The goal is to **predict the best times to park** based on past data.  
Combine this with prediction tools for best results.

> 🚀 Example: “This spot is usually empty before 9 AM on weekdays.”

---

## ✍️ Step 4: Give Feedback  
If you notice outdated or unclear data:

👍 The chart matched what I’ve seen  
👎 It didn’t  
📝 Leave a note to explain  

> Feedback improves how data is presented and interpreted.
