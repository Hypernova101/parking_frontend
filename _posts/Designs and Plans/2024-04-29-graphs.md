# 📈 Designing the History & Graph Insights Page  
*Part of the SmartParkSD Project*

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Page  
Parking patterns repeat—but only if you know where to look.  
The **History & Graph Insights Page** helps users understand trends in parking availability and usage over time, so they can **plan smarter trips**. Whether you're trying to park on a busy Thursday night or avoid weekend rush hours, this page makes the data speak.

---

## 🧱 Page Goals & Core Features  

### 🧠 What should this page do?  
- ✅ Show historical meter usage and availability  
- ✅ Break down trends by hour, day, and location  
- ✅ Allow filtering by date range, zone, or meter  
- ✅ Provide visual charts (line, bar, heatmap)  
- ✅ Offer quick insights: peak hours, quietest times  
- ✅ Support mobile viewing with responsive graphs  
- ✅ Provide export/share options for power users  

---

## ✍️ Design Breakdown  

### 📅 1. Date & Time Range Picker  
**Function:**  
Let users select a timeframe to analyze.

**Design Elements:**  
- Calendar picker (start & end date)  
- Dropdown for time granularity (hourly, daily, weekly)  
- “Last 7 days” / “Last month” shortcuts  

**Why It Matters:**  
Users need flexibility to explore both recent patterns and longer-term behaviors.

---

### 🗺️ 2. Location Filter  
**Function:**  
Narrow results by zone, neighborhood, or specific meter.

**Design Elements:**  
- Search bar for address or meter ID  
- Dropdown list of predefined zones  
- Optional: map-select feature to draw a custom area  

**Why It Matters:**  
Parking is hyper-local. Showing trends where the user actually parks makes insights actionable.

---

### 📊 3. Insights Dashboard (Main Visual Section)  
**Function:**  
Display availability trends through clear, interactive charts.

**Graph Types:**  
- **Line Graph** – Show availability over hours/days  
- **Bar Chart** – Compare usage between weekdays  
- **Heatmap** – Visualize average demand by hour vs. day  
- **Histogram** – Distribution of parked durations (if available)

**Additional Features:**  
- Hover for tooltips (e.g., “77% occupied on Wed @ 2PM”)  
- Toggle different meters or zones on/off  
- Annotations like “Holiday” or “Event” to explain anomalies  

**Why It Matters:**  
A glance should reveal: when is it quiet? When is it chaos?  
Data → visual → insight.

---

### 💡 4. Summary Insights Box  
**Function:**  
Give users a quick, written summary of trends.

**Examples:**  
- “Tuesdays between 9–11 AM have the highest availability in Zone B.”  
- “Parking fills up quickly after 4PM on Fridays near Gaslamp.”  
- “This meter is typically 80% full by 10AM on weekdays.”

**Why It Matters:**  
Not everyone is a chart-reader. Natural language helps more users act on insights.

---

### ⬇️ 5. Export & Share Tools  
**Function:**  
Allow users to save or share the insights.

**Features:**  
- Export chart as PNG or CSV  
- “Copy Insight Summary” to clipboard  
- Shareable link with saved filters (e.g., for commuters, planners)

**Why It Matters:**  
Useful data becomes more valuable when it's portable.

---

## 🔐 Optional: Logged-In Features  

**When a user is authenticated:**  
- ⭐ Save custom chart views or meter comparisons  
- 📬 Get email notifications for low-demand time windows  
- 📜 Track personal parking history and correlate with trends

## 🛠️ Technical Considerations  

| Component         | Tech Used                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Charting Library  | Chart.js or Recharts (React-based)  |
| UI Framework      | Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS           |

| Filtering Logic   | React state + query parameters       |
| Export Feature    | HTML2Canvas / FileSaver.js          |

## 🧪 Mobile-First Focus  

Designed with touch and scroll interactions in mind:
- Graphs resize for small screens  
- Filter controls stack vertically  
- Summary box floats above scrollable content  
- Export options tucked into dropdown menus  

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria  

- ✅ Users can clearly see how parking demand changes by time  
- ✅ Trends are visible and meaningful at a glance  
- ✅ Filters and charts are intuitive and fast  
- ✅ Page is helpful for both daily drivers and city planners

## 🏁 Final Thoughts  

The **History & Graph Insights Page** closes the loop for SmartParkSD.  
It empowers users with hindsight—and foresight—so parking becomes a matter of choice, not chance.  

> Past data. Present clarity. Future confidence.
