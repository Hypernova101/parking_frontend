# 💰 Designing the Pricing and Rates Page  
*Part of the SmartParkSD Project*

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Page  
Parking costs are often confusing and inconsistent across time, location, and meter type.  
The **Pricing and Rates Page** is designed to offer **clarity and transparency** to users—helping them understand what they'll pay, when, and why. It supports smarter trip planning and builds trust with users.

---

## 🧱 Page Goals & Core Features  

### 🧠 What should this page do?  
- ✅ Show hourly rates for all meter zones  
- ✅ Indicate time-based pricing (e.g. surge or peak-hour rates)  
- ✅ Display maximum stay durations  
- ✅ Allow filtering by area or ZIP code  
- ✅ Support mobile-first readability  
- ✅ Clarify how dynamic pricing (if any) works  
- ✅ Link to city payment policies and contact info  

---

## ✍️ Design Breakdown  

### 🗺️ 1. Interactive Zone Map (Top Section)  
**Function:**  
Give users a bird’s-eye view of pricing zones across the city.

**Design Elements:**  
- Color-coded zones by price range  
- Tooltip on hover with: base rate, hours enforced, and restrictions  
- Toggle to highlight meters with surge pricing  
- Click-to-zoom on specific areas  

**Why It Matters:**  
Users can visually identify where affordable parking is available—and plan around high-cost areas.

---

### 🔍 2. Pricing Table (Main Content)  
**Function:**  
Provide detailed pricing info in a clear, sortable table.

**Design Elements:**  
- Columns: Zone | Rate/hr | Enforced Hours | Max Stay | Notes  
- Sort and filter tools (e.g., by cost, zone, restrictions)  
- Icons or badges for special notes (e.g., “No Sunday Enforcement”)  

**Why It Matters:**  
Not everyone prefers maps. A list-based view ensures accessibility and helps users compare options directly.

---

### 📅 3. Time-Based Rate Breakdown  
**Function:**  
Clarify how pricing may change based on time of day or week.

**Design Elements:**  
- Timeline or tabbed breakdown per zone  
- Clear indicators of peak hours  
- Textual explanations: "From 4–6PM, rate increases to $3/hr due to high demand"  
- Tooltip definitions for “dynamic pricing” or “surge rates”  

**Why It Matters:**  
Time-based pricing is complex. Users need to know not just the cost—but **when** the cost applies.

---

### 🛂 4. Rules, Limits & Exceptions Section  
**Function:**  
Explain other non-price constraints or policies.

**Content Includes:**  
- Maximum stay durations (e.g., 2 hours max in Zone A)  
- Weekend/holiday enforcement info  
- Vehicle type exceptions (e.g., motorcycles, EVs, delivery vans)  
- Links to official city documents or ordinance references  

**Why It Matters:**  
Parking decisions are about more than cost. This section helps users avoid tickets or misinterpretations.

---

### ❓ 5. FAQs Section  
**Function:**  
Answer common questions about rates and enforcement.

**Sample Questions:**  
- Why does the price change at certain times?  
- Are rates different for residents or employees?  
- What happens if I overstay a meter?  
- How do I dispute a parking charge?

**Why It Matters:**  
Reduces user confusion and helps prevent calls/emails to city support.

---

## 🔐 Optional: Logged-In User Enhancements  

**When a user is authenticated:**  
- ⭐ View preferred zones or saved areas  
- 🔔 Set alerts if pricing in a zone changes  
- 📜 View recent transactions or payment history (if integrated)

| UI Framework      | Bootstrap                      |
| Mapping           | Leaflet.js or Google Maps      |
| Rate Data Source  | Static JSON or city API        |
| Time-based Logic  | JavaScript front-end display   |
| State Management  | React / Context API or Redux   |

## 🧪 Mobile-First Focus  

We designed this page to work seamlessly on mobile:
- Tables collapse into cards with summary stats

## 🎯 Success Criteria  

- ✅ Rates are clear, consistent, and easy to find  
- ✅ Users understand when prices vary and why  
- ✅ Page loads fast, especially on mobile  
- ✅ Fewer support requests related to “how much does it cost?”  
- ✅ Users feel empowered to make informed decisions

## 🏁 Final Thoughts  

The **Pricing and Rates Page** is more than just a table of numbers—it’s a transparency tool.  
By giving users clear insight into costs, we reduce friction, improve compliance, and build public trust in SmartParkSD.
