<h2>User Stories</h2>
<p>As <em>Alex</em>, a daily commuter, I want to see parking availability predictions before I leave for my destination so that I can save time searching for a spot and reduce stress.</p>
<h3>Flow of the System</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Initially, a user lands on the homepage where they can enter their destination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After entering the destination, the system displays a table with predicted parking availability for nearby locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users can sort the table by probability, distance, or parking fee (if applicable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no parking is predicted to be available, alternative locations with better availability are suggested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A feedback form allows users to report whether the prediction was accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system continuously improves by incorporating feedback into the machine-learning model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With this system, users can plan their trips efficiently, reduce time wasted searching for parking, and contribute to improving the model's accuracy for future users.</p>
